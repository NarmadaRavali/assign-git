• What does fast-forward in Git mean?

When the brach is not divergent from master, Git can fast-forward master to catch up with the latest commit on that branch. It just moves the master pointer. 
 • Why should you have different branches?

It helps developers isolate their code from the original code. Further branching allows developers to merge master into their branch and check for conflicts or test the code to see if integration is working as expected before committing it into their local repository. Once merging is completed and conflicts are resolved on local repository it's easy to push into the remote repository.
 • In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have? 

Usually there is 1 remote repository. When we clone a project Git automatically creates a remote connection called origin pointing back to the cloned repository from which we can pull and fetch changes.
